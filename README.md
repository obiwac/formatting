# formatting

Collection of my (personally opinionated) configs for popular formatters.

Generally I try to motivate my opinions with reasoning to an extent, especially in my configuration for `clang-format` in `.clang-format`.

I also have GitHub Actions here for each language, both to ensure my formatter configs are coherent and to serve as a reference for myself.
